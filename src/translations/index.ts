    whyAI1Desc: "То, что занимает у человеческих аналитиков часы или дни, наш ИИ выполняет за секунды. Получайте комплексную аналитику мгновенно вместо ручного исследования финансовых показателей, новостей и графиков на нескольких платформах.",
    whyAI2Title: "Устранение эмоциональных предубеждений",
    whyAI2Desc: "ИИ не влюбляется в акции и не продает в панике. Получайте объективный анализ на основе данных, свободный от предвзятости подтверждения, FOMO или страха. Принимайте решения на основе фактов, а не эмоций.",
    whyAI3Title: "Данные институционального уровня",
    whyAI3Desc: "Получите доступ к тому же качеству анализа, которое используют хедж-фонды и институты, но за малую долю стоимости. Наш ИИ обрабатывает миллионы точек данных, чтобы найти скрытые возможности и риски.",

    riskWarningP1: "Наш анализ акций ИИ предназначен для улучшения вашего исследовательского процесса, а не для его замены. Хотя наши модели достигают 73% направленной точности в 30-дневных прогнозах, никакое предсказание не может гарантировать будущие результаты. Рынки по своей природе непредсказуемы и подвержены влиянию бесчисленных переменных.",
    riskWarningP2: "Лучшая практика: Используйте наш анализ как одну точку данных в процессе принятия решений. Просмотрите SWOT-анализ, бычьи/медвежьи сценарии и финансовые метрики, чтобы понять полную картину. Объедините наши аналитические данные с вашим собственным исследованием, толерантностью к риску и инвестиционными целями.",

Случайный выбор по своей природе не имеет контекста об основах компании, рыночных условиях или ваших личных инвестиционных целях.",
    randomPickerDisclaimerP2: "Лучшая Практика: Используйте случайные выборы для пробуждения исследования, затем продолжайте с нашей функцией Анализа ИИ, чтобы понять техническую сторону акции, настроение и финансовое здоровье.

    randomPickerFAQ3A: "Абсолютно! Как только вы выберете акцию, вы можете нажать 'Анализ (1C)', чтобы получить мгновенный анализ на основе ИИ, включая технические индикаторы, анализ настроений, оценку рисков и инвестиционные рекомендации. Наш ИИ просматривает новости, финансовые показатели и рыночные тенденции, чтобы дать вам всеобъемлющие идеи.",
    randomPickerFAQ4Q: "Должен ли я инвестировать исключительно на основе случайных выборов?",
    randomPickerFAQ4A: "Нет. Случайный выбор предназначен для открытия и преодоления предвзятости выбора, а не как самостоятельная инвестиционная стратегия. Всегда используйте нашу функцию Анализа ИИ и проводите дополнительную проверку перед принятием инвестиционных решений. Случайные выборы работают лучше всего как часть процесса исследования диверсифицированного портфеля.",
